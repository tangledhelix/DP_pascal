   13410: syllogism: “The pope has condemned the doctrine of <span class='red'>Jansenius</span>;
   13413: <span class='red'>Jansenius</span>.”[336] If this mode of reasoning were conclusive,
   13421: represented to him as the doctrine of <span class='red'>Jansenius</span>.
   13427: to condemn <span class='red'>Jansenius</span> with the less scruple. When this object
   13429: as an eternal testimony in condemnation of <span class='red'>Jansenius</span>, will
   13432: be forthcoming in proper time. “The doctrine of <span class='red'>Jansenius</span>,”
   13447: decline acknowledging that <span class='red'>Jansenius</span> has maintained the propositions
   13479: found in the pages of <span class='red'>Jansenius</span>. They are innocent of all error;
   13480: It may be that they interpret <span class='red'>Jansenius</span> too favorably; but
   13487: you, father; they have examined <span class='red'>Jansenius</span> more faithfully than
   13528: from <span class='red'>Jansenius</span>, and were heretical in the sense in which
   13529: (<span class='red'>Jansenius</span>) employed them. This was a more stringent constitution
   13597: intrigues employed in the condemnation of <span class='red'>Jansenius</span>. (Note by
   13693: of <span class='red'>Jansenius</span>,” which you insist on their doing without explanation.
   13696: The answer was ready, therefore, that if <span class='red'>Jansenius</span> has no

   13704: the genuine sense of <span class='red'>Jansenius</span>, and had the only difference

   13718: declaring what you understand by the sense of <span class='red'>Jansenius</span>. But, as
   13725: do, that this was exactly the doctrine of <span class='red'>Jansenius</span>. This
   13735: that “if <span class='red'>Jansenius</span> was capable of any other sense than that
   13740: vindication of <span class='red'>Jansenius</span>, to allege that he merely holds the
   13749: grant, father; but you conclude by adding: “<span class='red'>Jansenius</span> would
   13753: enter upon the question of fact, whether <span class='red'>Jansenius</span> really
   13755: you now inform me that by the sense of <span class='red'>Jansenius</span> you have
   13758: get condemned, under the name of “the sense of <span class='red'>Jansenius</span>?”
   13765: <span class='red'>Jansenius</span>.” The whole Church was in the utmost perplexity about
   13770: sense of <span class='red'>Jansenius</span> is neither more nor less than the sense
   13773: under these terms—_the sense of <span class='red'>Jansenius</span>_—is neither more nor
   13777: bishops manifested against “the sense of <span class='red'>Jansenius</span>.” How,
   13948: will not allow that the sense of <span class='red'>Jansenius</span> is the same with that
   13952: would it be so to doubt that <span class='red'>Jansenius</span> held that doctrine?
   13960: stupid—that they misunderstand <span class='red'>Jansenius</span>. These would be charges
   13964: rightly understand <span class='red'>Jansenius</span>. All I shall say on the point,
   13968: “whether <span class='red'>Jansenius</span> is sound or not, we must inquire whether
   14003: <span class='red'>Jansenius</span>; but we shall not be the less on that account children
   14010: understand <span class='red'>Jansenius</span> as you do? For what else in the world
   14016: refuse to say that they condemn the sense of <span class='red'>Jansenius</span>, it is
   14022: use of the word <span class='red'>Jansenius</span>, on both sides; and thus, by obliging
   14030: Catholics, whether they condemn <span class='red'>Jansenius</span>, on finding him
