### Project manager notes ###

The full title of the work is *THE PROVINCIAL LETTERS of BLAISE PASCAL. A NEW TRANSLATION WITH HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION AND NOTES.*  The original images are from [TIA](https://archive.org/details/provincialletter00pasciala/page/n5/mode/2up).

The Provincial Letters, originally published in the 17th century, was banned for its religious views. This book is being run for Banned Book Week.

This is an old text. The pages are stained, there is some blotching on the scans. The orthography is old. Ask questions in the project thread. 

### Forum notes ###

135, 136: Discussion of Greek transliteration - added to revisit section. A
later round reverted to transliteration unfortunately.

348: Discussion of a questionable diacritical - added to revisit section for
review. It is probably marked as a proofer note.

One poster is using an [alternate edition][1] with much better scans. Although
this should be used only cautiously in case they differ. (The poster believed
they didn't differ other than in pagination).

201: Discussion of something that looked like a footnote marker, without a
footnote to accompany it. Also a few pages prior to that. PM notes it is a
printer's mark, and another appears on 217.

One poster notes the punctuation in the footnotes is "very sketchy", even
after consulting TIA.

### General notes ###

### Illustrations ###

- [x] A cover will need to be fabricated
- [ ] 393 through 404: these are publisher's ads and have decorative borders

### Proofer's notes ###

- Many "unclear punctuation mark" type comments not noted here. Especially
  in footnotes. Made use of an [alternate scan][2] to try to clear up
  discrepancies. It's a different edition, but the text and even pages are
  (so far as I've seen) identical, so it's been a good resource, especially
  for punctuation; it's a much clearer scan.
- 009 (p. ix) - corrected "Protestanism" to "Protestantism"
- 030: `downfal[**downfall?]` - per Ngrams this is a fairly common usage as you
  go back in time, especially before 1800. From 1680 to 1800 they're on almost
  equal footing in the Ngram graph. There are no other uses of either within
  this text. Leaving as-is.
- 033, 035: `Sarbonne[**Sorbonne?]` - 44 uses of Sorbonne, 3 Sarbonne (all
  3 of which were questioned by proofers). Ngrams suggests Sarbonne is not
  used, even if you look back to 1600. Will correct these instances.
- 094: `perfeet[** perfect?:P1]`
- 104: `terrribly[**terribly]`
- 110: `number[**? nnmber ? F1]`
- 118: `wave[**waive?]` - per 1828 dictionary, it's an alternate spelling
- 168: `sylllogism[** syllogism]`
- 209: missing opening single-quote
- 211: `was[**has]`
- 286: `surmont[**P2: surmount?]`
- 347: `M. de l aLane[**P2 la Lane ?]`
